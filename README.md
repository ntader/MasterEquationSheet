# Welcome to the MES (Master Equation Sheet) GitHub!

### **Current Version: 1.0.1** (8/30/23)

This sheet contains equations used in engineering undergraduate classes from freshman through sophomore year. Subjects include but are not limited to mathematics, physics, and general engineering. A list of scientific constants and conversions are given at the end as well, in addition to notes on each equation/principle as necessary. Note that this sheet is not an exhaustive list, it is simply meant as an extra resource.

## Equation Sheet

The master sheet can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/ntader/MasterEquationSheet/releases/tag/Master) or it can be viewed in-browser [here](https://github.com/ntader/MasterEquationSheet/blob/main/Master%20Sheet.pdf).  
Version v1.0.1: Fixed e^(nx) derivative.

## Looking forward
* Ideally, this *could* become a hub for subject specific cheat-sheets/equation sheets (I.e. Calc I,II, Physics I, etc). However, I am just one writer and there are already a fair amount of good subject specific sheets out there. If you feel like a subject could use a sheet that doesn't have one yet, please leave a [suggestion](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_Ul6LK3SoAwD1fWSKSIAGPCY3ctJZWpWQhVekjFJ4Jq8fMA/viewform?usp=sf_link) (you can also create a comment through github, which will probably get to me faster). Once enough suggestions are received (and time is available) the committee and/or I will begin working on it.

## FAQ

**Will this be useful to me?**   

* I believe so - the sheet is made with STEM majors in mind, so if you are in a STEM related major (or taking a STEM class), I believe the sheet will serve you well.



**How do you not have equation X? It is a major part of Y!** 

* Each school has its own classes and syllabi. Because of this, I cannot guarantee that something covered in a class I took was covered in a class/topic you have or are currently taking/studying. That being said, I have added as much useful info to each subject that I think universally is beneficial. 

* Also, keep in mind that this sheet is to serve as an *overall* reference for *any* STEM major/student. Because of this, diving too deep into major specific equations may make this list too long and irrelevant to the general public. Also, double check each topic! I try to avoid having duplicate equations, so an equation may be under a different topic.


**Why does the intro only mention equations used in freshman-sophomore year?**

* At the time of writing this, I only have knowledge/feel confident writing about classes freshman through sophomore year. As time goes on this will change, but I imagine the MES will not. Most high level classes start to get very major specific (which is a problem described above), and the goal is that most students could use at least 80% of the sheet. By adding those upper level equations, the sheet becomes more and more irrelevant as a whole.





**This seems cool. Can I help?**   

* Consider filling out the [MES committee form!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_Ul6LK3SoAwD1fWSKSIAGPCY3ctJZWpWQhVekjFJ4Jq8fMA/viewform?usp=sf_link) The committee will vote on if equations should be added, and discuss future sheets to be made.



**How did you create the sheet?**  

* Everything was done on Apple Pages. Because of the built-in LaTeX editor + downloaded CMU font, it appears to be written in LaTeX (which I suppose is partially true). The logo was created in Procreate.

**Why did you create the sheet?**  

* I made it because I got tired of having to look across multiple equation sheets online. Hopefully this will help future students, as I wish I had something like this my first 2 years of school.

**How long did this take?**
* It took a month or two to gather all the equations for classes from past professors and teachers, but in total no more than 20 hours.


**What else is going to be added to the sheet?** 

- *Subtopics: (none listed)*
- *Topics: Physics I-III, General Engineering Courses (Statics, Dynamics, Mech. of Materials), Chemistry*
- *Appendix: Unit Conversions, Unit Circle, Periodic Table, General English Units, General Metric Units*


**What was fixed in past releases**?  

8/30/23 - v1.0.1: Fixed e^(nx) derivative.  
8/30/23 - v1.0: First upload, featuring the mathematics section!
