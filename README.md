### **Current Version: 1.3.1** (Released 2/1/24)

This sheet contains equations used in engineering undergraduate classes from freshman through sophomore year. Subjects include but are not limited to mathematics, physics, and general engineering. A list of scientific constants and prefixes are given at the end as well, in addition to notes on each equation/principle as necessary. Note that this sheet is not an exhaustive list, it is simply meant as an extra resource.

## Equation Sheets

The master sheet can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/ntader/MasterEquationSheet/releases/tag/Master) or it can be viewed in-browser [here](https://github.com/ntader/MasterEquationSheet/blob/main/Master%20Sheet%20v1.3.1%20Eqn's%20Only.pdf). It's recommended to bookmark this page and use the files at the top, since they will always be the most recent version (as opposed to a downloaded pdf).  


## FAQ

**Will this be useful to me?**   

* I believe so - the sheet is made with STEM majors in mind, so if you are in a STEM related major (or taking a STEM class), I believe the sheet will serve you well.



**How do you not have equation X? It is a major part of Y!** 

* Each school has its own classes and syllabi. Because of this, I cannot guarantee that something covered in a class I took was covered in a class/topic you have or are currently taking/studying. That being said, I have added as much useful info to each subject that I think universally is beneficial. 

* Also, double check each topic! I try to avoid having too many duplicate equations, so an equation may be under a different topic/heading.




**How did you create the sheet?**  

* Everything was done on Apple Pages. Because of the built-in LaTeX editor + downloaded CMU font, it appears to be written in LaTeX (which I suppose is partially true). The logo was created in Procreate.

**Why did you create the sheet?**  

* I made it because I got tired of having to look across multiple equation sheets online. Hopefully this will help future students, as I wish I had something like this my first 2 years of school.


**Why is there such a big "Materials Engineering" section?**  
* It's my major, so I have some bias towards it:)


**What else is going to be added to the sheet?** 

- *Subtopics: (none listed)*
- *Topics: Chemistry*
- *Appendix: Unit Conversions, Periodic Table, General English Units, General Metric Units*


**What was fixed in past releases**?  

* 2/1/24 - v1.3.1: Added diamond cubic lattice parameter.
* 2/1/24 - v1.3: Added Materials Engineering.
* 1/31/24 - v1.2.1: Fixed formatting issues.
* 1/31/24 - v1.2: Added a color system. Added physics III (intro to quantum mechanics), more physics II equations, dynamics, mechanics (of materials), and the unit circle in the appendix.
* 9/11/23 - v1.1a: Includes physics 1 and 2. 
* 8/30/23 - v1.0.1: Fixed e^(nx) derivative.  
* 8/30/23 - v1.0: First upload, featuring the mathematics section!
